#Specification : Spell System Refactor

##Objectives
* Any champion can cast any spell, spells can be swapped in-game easily(support of this feature allows many gamemodes)
* Spells can be customized to trigger other spells(or have full and complete logic for triggering any amount of projectiles/self buffs/toggles- think Doombots)
* There shouldn't be guesswork. When someone is making a spell script, they should have access to all the logic and information. It should be clear what a spell is doing and how it is doing it in the spell script. Minimal things should happen automatically outside of the spell script's control
* Less ambiguity, we shouldn't need to have functions if a spell doesn't need them. Leads to confusion
